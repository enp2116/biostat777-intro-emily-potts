    "text": "I’m currently a first-year PhD student in Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University, where I aim to address statistical challenges in the measurement of neurological and psychiatric disorders. I hold an MS in Biostatistics from Columbia University and a BA in Mathematics and Statistics from Vassar College.\nMy previous research has focused on patient safety and trial outcomes in early-phase trials, particularly phase II trials in oncology. I have also completed internships across diverse fields, including statistical genetics, pharmaceutical statistics, and social justice research. Most recently, I worked for the Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design (BERD) resource at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, where I fostered a passion for translational education. I enjoy teaching and have previously led teaching assistant efforts for courses in biostatistics, public health, and aging at Columbia University.\nThroughout my academic journey, I have been honored to be involved as a QuestBridge Scholar, Columbia Tow Doctoral Scholar, and member of the Delta Omega Honorary Society. Coming from a first-generation, low-income background, I am committed to supporting others through STEM mentorship."
