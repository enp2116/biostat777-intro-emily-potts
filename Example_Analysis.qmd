:::

### Dataset

The public dataset on Mr. Trash Wheel is provided by the Waterfront Partnership of Baltimore in the form of a Google spreadsheet.

The Mr.Â Trash Wheel spreadsheet is largely self-explanatory, and includes information on the dumpter number, date of collection, amount of total litter and litter type. Additional spreadsheets for Professor Trash wheel and for precipitation amounts are also included in the document.

Data Dictionary: You must include a link to a data dictionary for the data or create one inside the webpage.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
# Data Dictionary for Dumpster Data
dumpster_data_dict = data.frame(
  Variable = c("Dumpster", "Month", "Year", "Date", "Weight (tons)", "Volume (cubic yards)", 
               "Plastic Bottles", "Polystyrene", "Cigarette Butts", "Plastic Bags", "Wrappers", "Homes Powered*"),
  Description = c("Identifier for the dumpster", "Month of data collection", "Year of data collection", 
                  "Date of data collection", "Weight of waste in tons", "Volume of waste in cubic yards", 
                  "Count of plastic bottles", "Count of polystyrene items", "Count of cigarette butts", 
                  "Count of plastic bags", "Count of wrappers", "Estimated number of homes powered by the waste")

### Question

### Data Processing

3.  Your analysis must include some minimal form of data wrangling with you using at least five different functions from `dplyr` or `tidyr`.

### Methods

3.  Methods:
    -   Your analysis must include one image or table (not one you created yourself, but one you have saved locally or one from the web).

    -   Your analysis must include at least two different [callout blocks](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html).

    -   Your analysis must include the use of at least 1 [margin content](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html#margin-content).

### Exploratory Data Analysis

3.  

    -   Your analysis should include at least three plots with you using at least three different `geom_*()` functions from `ggplot2` (or another package with `geom_*()` functions).

    -   Plots should have titles, subtitles, captions, and human-understandable axis labels.

    -   At least one plot should using a type of faceting (`facet_grid()` or `facet_wrap()`).

4.  List of functions: At the end of the data analysis, list out each of the functions you used from each of the packages (`dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot2`) to help the TA with respect to making sure you met all the requirements described above.

### Discussion

3.  You must summarize your analysis and/or results with a paragraph (4-6 sentences).
